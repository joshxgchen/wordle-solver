# Wordle Game Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to the Wordle game! This Python program allows you to play the classic Wordle game, where you must guess a hidden word using a combination of letters. This readme will provide you with instructions on how to set up and play the game.

## Installation

To play the Wordle game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Download the provided Python file (`.py`) and the associated word bank file (`.txt`) into the same folder on your computer.

3. Make sure all the files are in the same directory, as the program relies on these files being in the same location to work correctly.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python program by executing the `.py` file in your Python environment.

2. The program will provide you with an initial word guess and display instructions on the screen.

3. Enter your word guess following the rules:
   - Letters that are in the correct position and spelling will be displayed in green ('=').
   - Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position will be displayed in gray ('-').

4. After entering your word guess, the program will provide feedback based on your guess in the same format. Continue entering guesses and using the feedback until you correctly guess the hidden word.

5. Keep entering your guesses and analyzing the feedback until you successfully crack the word.

## Example

Suppose the program gives you the initial guess "APPLE" and the feedback is "A-P-P--." To respond, you would enter "A-P-P-L-E" as your next guess.

## Enjoy the Game!

That's it! You are now ready to enjoy the Wordle game. Test your word-guessing skills and deduction abilities to uncover the hidden word. Good luck and have fun!
